Commodity hardware is reaching fundamental limits, while the demands of data-
intensive applications continue to grow. Thus, we now rely on horizontal scale-out
and hardware accelerators to improve application performance and scale, while de-
veloping a myriad of distributed execution frameworks that are specialized to specific
application domains, from data analytics to machine learning. While this reduces
burden for certain applications, it also creates three problems: (1) duplicated system
implementation effort, (2) reduced framework evolvability, and (3) difficulty interop-
erating efficiently between applications, especially when large data is involved.
